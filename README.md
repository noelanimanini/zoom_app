# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Inspiration
According to the Census Bureau and the World Health Organization, **"The population of people with different disabilities in the United States is a total of 49 million and 1 billion globally"**. In other words, 1 in 5 people has a disability. Disabilities range from hearing and vision loss to cognitive impairment, neurodivergent conditions,  loss of mobility,  etc. 

During the pandemic, when work from home became the new norm and using Zoom to conduct conference meetings became a necessity, individuals with disabilities became marginalized even further due to the structure and exclusivity of the Zoom platform. 

Digital accessibility and inclusion are essential. 

From school, to work, to casual socialization, video conferencing has become an efficient way to connect and share information with people near and far, especially since the COVID-19 shutdown. 

However, video conferencing creates many accessibility barriers, **meaning not all communities can participate equally**.
 
Digi-Clusive Meeting intends to remove those barriers, because, **in order to have true community, EVERY VOICE IS NECESSARY.**

## What it does
Digi-Clusive is an easily downloadable extension for Zoom to help make digital meet-ups more welcoming for people with a variety of accessibility needs. 

### Joining a Zoom Meeting 
Whenever someone joins a Zoom meeting, the new user will be prompted with a private message that states: 

>Thanks for joining the meeting. Please remember to mute your mic when you're not talking, raise your hand when you want to and turn on your captions when you do.
>Learn more about inclusive behaviors at: https://digiclusive.herokuapp.com/inclusive    

### Sending an Image to the Chat
Those who are visually impaired rely on screen readers to process digital text. However, screen readers cannot read images. Digi-Clusive works hard to identify images and reply with: 

>Please include a short description of the image you're sending

This asks the user to describe the image they sent in group settings. Thus, practicing inclusive behavior! 

### Reminders

To encourage **digital inclusion**, the extension sends automatic reminders for those joining Zoom to mute the mic when not speaking, turn on closed captioning, include image descriptions, and much more...

## How we built it
We built Digi-Clusive with React, Javascript, Python, React-Spring and Google API. We decorated with Canva and used Figma to visualize our layout. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into some issues with Git that had one of our team members working with 10 Hydrangea Hacks' mentors for nearly 5 hours. Thankfully, we were able to resolve the issue and Barbra learned a lot about Git, GitHub, and VS Code in the process. 

Internet connectivity for two of our other members created momentary productivity barriers, as a result, these team members pivoted and were able to rely on their mobile devices to continue to create Digi-Clusive. 

## Why the platform is useful
Digi-Clusive encourages inclusion amongst the general community to hear the voices of invisible minorities/communities. 

## What's next for Digi-Clusive Meetings

Initially, we wished to implement a muting function where participants can only unmute upon holding their space bar to prevent confusion from overhead sound for those with disabilities. Unfortunately, while working with the zoom API, there were some permission and security barriers that prohibited us from creating this feature. Therefore, in the future, we would like to build our own platform to implement this feature into our app and reach more communities
