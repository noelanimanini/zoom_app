# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About Digi-Clusive Meetings
From school, work, to casual socialization, video conferencing has become an efficient way to connect and share information with peoplenear and far, especially since the COVID-19 shutdown. 

However, video conferencing creates many accessibility barriers, meaning not all communities can participate equally. 

Digi-Clusive Meeting intends to remove those barriers, because, in order to have true community, every voice is necessary. Digital inclusivity and accessibility are essential to a flourishing community. 


## Why the platform is useful
Digi-Clusive encourages inclusion amongst the general community to hear the voices of invisible minorities/communities.
